TESTING YOUR CODE

When you write a function or class, you can also write tests for that code. Testing proves that your code works as it’s supposed to in response to all the kinds of input it’s designed to receive. 

When you write tests, you can be confident that your code will work correctly  as more people begin to use your programs. You’ll also be able to test new code as you add it, to make sure your changes don’t break your program’s existing behavior.
